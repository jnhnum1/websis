MIT Websis to Google Calendar Importer
======

This is some Javascript for MIT students to parse their course schedules from
WebSIS and add them to Google Calendar. 
# Directions
 1. Copy the code in the [main.js](main.js) file.
 2. Go to your [websis class schedule](https://student.mit.edu/cgi-bin/sfprwsch.sh)
 3. Go to the javascript console in Chrome (right-click, inspect element, clickconsole)
 4. Paste the code and press enter.  If you see an error about gapi typeerror, try again.
 5. Grant access.
 6. See your classes appear in your Google Calendar!
 7. Report an issue at https://github.com/jnhnum1/websis/issues if there are any problems.  
Note: If the times of your classes seem to be offset, check that your calendar has its timezone set to eastern time (GMT -5:00).
